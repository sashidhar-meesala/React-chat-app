Team: sashidhar meesala (N01324566)

## Working 
creating a chat room / annonymous channel chatting application using react and socket.io.

--The user is required to choose username and channel name so that a new channel gets created.

--As soon as the user enters the channel, a socket is opened and channel admin's message is emmited on to the screen.

--Now user can share this channel name and ask the other user to join the channel and vice-versa.

--Once the other user has the channel Name and enters the exact channel name the other users the same channel and gets greeted by the 
admin.

--Here, the other users will be notified about the new user that has entered the chat/channel.

--Now, users can send text messages to each other on channel.

--Once, the user leaves the channel or exits the chat . The same gets notified to the others users as well.

The project mainly focuses on the usage of components and socket.io.

# Deployment

I had deployed the server folder to heroku and obtained the endpoint after the successful deployment.

Now, I put the end-point in chat.js.
Next, I used npm-run-build on the client -> chat-app folder to get the build version of the client side.
I deployed the client to netflify by  simply drag and drop.
